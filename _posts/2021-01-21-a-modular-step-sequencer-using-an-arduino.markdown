One component that is really nice to have in a modular synth is a step sequencer. 
The first component I build was a simple dual 12V supply with a common ground to drive
the different modules. I started with the power supply because it is needed to provide 
the power for each module that I add. A second module would be a simple voltage controlled
oscillator. But an oscillator can only produce one note and not a sequence of notes. So to
be able to produce some "real" music, I felt that a step sequencer should be one of the 
first modules I should build.
